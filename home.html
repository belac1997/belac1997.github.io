   	<h2>Security With Human Centered Design</h2>
  </header>
    <main>
        <div id="tabs"> 
			<p>When it comes to computer security, 
			most people think about firewalls and complicated programs 
			that keep your computer safe from viruses. 
			However, humans are one of the biggest weaknesses when it 
			comes to security. Most people do not know all the interworking’s 
			of a computer system and will take shortcuts when a system seems 
			to complex to deal with. When a security breach happens due to a 
			person’s mistake, most programmers will simply say it was human 
			error and that people need to be taught how to use their complicated 
			programs.</p>
			<p>However, human center design aims to solve this 
			problem by building security with people being the focus. 
			There are three big ways human centered design has changed security. </p>

            <ul>
				<li><a href="#tabs-1">Human Interaction</a></li>
                <li><a href="#tabs-2">Training</a></li>
                <li><a href="#tabs-3">Reduction in Frustartion</a></li>
            </ul>
			<div id="tabs-1">
				<p>Computers practically speak a different language 
				compared to humans. People sometimes have no idea what 
				the computer is saying to them. By creating a system 
				which accounts for human interaction first, you can 
				<ul>
					<li>Enable people to understand what the computer is telling them</li>
					<li>Cause less confusion and frustration </li>
					<li>Have a more positive experience with the computer  </li>
				</ul>

				</p>
            </div>
            <div id="tabs-2">
				<p>Have a professional teach your employees on how to use a new 
				fancy program. People relate to people better than a ReadMe.txt document. 
				By having a professional physically teach people how use their program, 
				this allows for the learners to
				<ul>
					<li>Be engaged in the learning process</li>
					<li>See how a professional interacts with the program</li>
					<li>Ask questions immediately if they find something confusing</li>
				</ul>

            <div id="tabs-3">
				<p>The last thing you want to build a system that is 
				frustrating to work with. Even the smallest of inconveniences 
				can cause people’s attitudes to change. This is especially 
				true with technology since it was designed to be used by people. 
				A reduction in frustration will
				<ul>
					<li>Reduce people neglecting to use the security software</li>
					<li>Increase productivity</li>
					<li>Promote a heathier work environment</li>
				</ul>
