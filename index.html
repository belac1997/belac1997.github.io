				<p>My name is Caleb Rigby and I am a student at Santa Fe College. I have an A.S. in Programming and Analysis and a Certificate as a  Computer Programming Specialist.

				<p>The Weekly Wag was my final project for my first two HTML and CSS classes. All of the HTML and CSS is my original code. In addition, I made the website change the UI when the screen shrinks so the the website is easy to navigate on smart phones and tablets.</p>

				<p>Greg's Games was my final progect for my first Javascript class. During the course of the class, we had to create various Javascript games and add them to a hub wesite that the teacher provided. The final progect was to have every single Javascript project linked to this hub website, change any HTML and CSS to our liking, and improve functionality and anyway I saw fit.</p>

				<p>The Memory Game was my final progect for my second Javascript class. The main goal of this project was to create a card matching game using Javascript to build the board of cards. I had to create seperate Javascript files for each task and stack each file in the correct order for the game to work.</p>
